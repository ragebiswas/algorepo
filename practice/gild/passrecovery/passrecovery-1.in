The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher that uses shared secret encryption.
It was selected by the National Bureau of Standards as an official Federal Information 
Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1976 and which has subsequently 
enjoyed widespread use internationally.
It is based on a symmetric-key algorithm that uses a 56-bit key. The algorithm was 
initially controversial with classified design elements, a relatively short key length, 
and suspicions about a National Security Agency (NSA) backdoor.
DES consequently came under intense academic scrutiny which motivated the modern 
understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.
DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications.
This is chiefly due to the 56-bit key size being too small;
in January, 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated 
to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see chronology).
