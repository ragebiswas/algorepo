Algorithms and Practice Programs
--------------------------------

This repository contains all practice and programming contest C/C++/Python programs that I have ever written. 

Nothing here is guaranteed to work, but if it helps you, I'd be glad to know :-)

### Programming sites for each subdirectory:

  * [CodeChef](http://codechef.com)
  * [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/)
  * [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)
  * [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup)
  * [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/)
  * [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.pl/) 

The `practice` folder contains assorted programs not specific to any programming site / contest.

Feel free to contact me for any questions.
